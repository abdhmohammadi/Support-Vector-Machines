  <h3><b>SVM basic totorial</b></h3>In this section, we have reviewed the basic concepts of the support vector machine algorithm, we have calculated its details manually with a very simple mathematical example, and we have shown that our results are the same as those of sklearn.
 <h3><b>SVM algoritm</b></h3>A relatively comprehensive review of the SVM algorithm has been conducted and its sensitivity to various parameters has been investigated.
  <h3><b>Least Squares twin SVM(LSTWSVM)</b></h3>
  we are trying to implement the Least Squares Twin SVM version for the SVM algorithm, for ease of expression, we will call it LSTwinSVM from now on. LSTwinSVM was published by Arun Kumar and Gopal in an article titled Least squares twin support vector machines for pattern classification in Science Direct magazine on May 4, 2009, which develops the basic SVM algorithm using two non-parallel hyperplanes. In this article, a binary classification problem is divided into two classes like other SVM methods, but instead of finding two parallel hyperplanes, it searches for non-parallel hyperplanes.
