  <li>SVM basic totorial</li>
        In this section, we have reviewed the basic concepts of the support vector machine algorithm, we have calculated its details manually with a very simple 
        mathematical example, and we have shown that our results are the same as those of sklearn.
  <li>SVM algoritm</li>
  A relatively comprehensive review of the SVM algorithm has been conducted and its sensitivity to various parameters has been investigated.
